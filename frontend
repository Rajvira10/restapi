1st of all, there will be two roles. Admin and Student. The Student will only get to see the questions and choose one answer and then submit. The questions will be shown in the screen with the GET request that we implemented in the backend. After the student submits the answer, the frontend will check if “isCorrect === true”. The admin can post, delete and update the questions with the POST, DELETE and PUT request of the backend. There will be an admin panel for it where all the existing questions will be there using the GET request. Whenever the admin updates or adds a question, the PUT and POST request will fire with a function. And for the purpose of SPA, we can update the state that we used to collect all the question when we used the GET request.
